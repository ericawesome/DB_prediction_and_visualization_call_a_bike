# awesome_prediction_call_a_bike (24h hackathon)


(1) First Part of the MVP is a **Prediction model for the supply of bicycles for call-a-bike at 200 stations in Hamburg**. Based on the provided data from the years 2014-2015 and considering weather data (temperature, wind speed, precipitation), holidays, school holidays.

(2) Second Part of the MVP is a **Visualization of the rootes from the station to understand the relocation of the bikes during the day**. 

With the model (GradientBoostingRegressor) we predicted with 10 features used the demand with a accuracy of 76% in average.

The seasonality of demand for Call-a-Bike bicycles in Hamburg over the two years is shown below:

The prediction model provides after 24h a first good approach to the real data:
