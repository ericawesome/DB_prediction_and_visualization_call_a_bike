# awesome_DeutscheBahn_call_a_bike (24h hackathon)


(1) First Part of the MVP is a **Prediction model for the supply of bicycles for call-a-bike at 200 stations in Hamburg**. Based on the provided data from the years 2014-2015 and considering weather data (temperature, wind speed, precipitation), holidays, school holidays.

(2) Second Part of the MVP is a **Visualization of the rootes from the station to understand the relocation of the bikes during the day**. 

* The seasonality of demand for Call-a-Bike bicycles in Hamburg over the two years is shown below:

With the model (GradientBoostingRegressor > RandomForestRegressor) we predicted with 10 features the bookings of shared bicycles with an average accuracy of 74%. The forecasting model provides a first good approach to real data after 24 hours of hacking, but can be improved with a little more feature engineering and aggregation of data from nearby car rental stations:
